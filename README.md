##Game Description
You’re a monkey climbing in between the 2 tallest trees in the world, trying to collect bananas and avoid crashing into a branch and falling to your doom. Every branch you path is worth 1 point and each banana grabbed is worth 3 points.

The controls are as simple as can be! Every button, include the 4 d-pad directions, will make the monkey jump between the two trees in order to dodge branches and collect bananas. It is also one of the few Arduboy games I have seen that plays in Tate mode (requires rotating your Arduboy 90 degrees counter clockwise).

If you get a high score or have suggestions, I’d love to hear from you. Feedback is always welcome, especially as I look to polish the difficulty and maybe add a couple more features down the line.
